    Contraception, also known as birth control, is a method or device used to prevent pregnancy. It allows individuals to choose if and when they want to have children by controlling the timing and occurrence of conception. There are various types of contraception available, each with different mechanisms of action and levels of effectiveness.

Some common methods of contraception include:

    <p>Hormonal methods: These include birth control pills, patches, injections, and vaginal rings that release hormones to prevent ovulation.</p>
    <p>Barrier methods: Such as condoms, diaphragms, and cervical caps, which physically prevent sperm from reaching the egg.</p>
    <p>Intrauterine devices (IUDs): Small devices inserted into the uterus that can prevent pregnancy for several years.</p>
    <p>Sterilization: A permanent method achieved through surgical procedures like vasectomy for men and tubal ligation for women.</p>
    <p>Natural methods: Involving tracking fertility and abstaining from sex during the most fertile periods of the menstrual cycle.</p>
